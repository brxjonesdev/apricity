# Apricity - Forge Worlds, Weave Stories

**The author's workspace where manuscripts meet worldbuilding.**

## Your Tool for Creative Mastery

Apricity is designed specifically to help authors craft complex narratives by
uniting the writing process with deep worldbuilding:

- **Write & Connect:** Draft your manuscript with scenes that link directly to
  plot events, character arcs, and worldbuilding elements.
- **Weave Intricate Plots:** Track events across multiple timelines and
  storylines with Plotweaver—see how every thread intertwines.
- **Build Living Worlds:** Create detailed locations, cultures, magic systems,
  and histories that inform every scene.
- **Develop Rich Characters:** Track profiles, relationships, and character arcs
  that evolve throughout your story.
- **Never Lose an Idea:** Capture research, inspiration, and notes—all organized
  and searchable in one place.

## What Makes Us Different?

- **Bidirectional Linking:** Connect scenes to events, characters to locations,
  plot threads to character arcs—and navigate between them instantly.
- **Timeline-Driven Storytelling:** Your plot events and scenes exist on a
  visual timeline, making non-linear narratives manageable.
- **Unified Workspace:** No more juggling between Word docs, spreadsheets, and
  note apps—everything lives together.
- **Built for Authors, By Authors:** Every feature exists to serve your story,
  not distract from it.
